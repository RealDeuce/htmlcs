This will be an application written in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS that behaves as a character sheet, tracking all status, inventory, effects, etc.

It does not require a network connection, and all data is stored locally.

This is a work in progress, but will eventually have SRD OGL content along with Kobold Press OGL content.
